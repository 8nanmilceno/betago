In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a simple animation using Adobe Flash Professional CS6. You will learn how to draw a character, add motion tweens, and use symbols and instances.
 
Step 1: Draw a character. Select the Oval tool from the Tools panel and draw a circle on the Stage. This will be the head of your character. You can change the color and stroke of the circle using the Properties panel. Next, select the Line tool and draw two lines for the eyes and a curve for the mouth. You can also use the Selection tool to adjust the shape and position of your lines.
 
Step 2: Add motion tweens. Select the head of your character and choose Modify > Convert to Symbol. A dialog box will appear where you can name your symbol and choose its type. Choose Movie Clip as the type and click OK. This will make your head a reusable symbol that you can animate. Next, right-click on frame 30 of the Timeline and choose Insert Keyframe. This will copy the content of frame 1 to frame 30. Then, select frame 15 and move the head slightly to the right using the arrow keys. You will see a dotted line connecting frame 1 and frame 15. This is a motion tween, which means that Flash will automatically create the frames between them to create a smooth animation. Right-click on any frame between 1 and 15 and choose Create Motion Tween from the context menu. You will see a solid line instead of a dotted line, indicating that the motion tween is applied. Repeat the same steps for frames 15 to 30, but move the head slightly to the left this time.
 
Step 3: Use symbols and instances. Now that you have a basic animation of your character's head, you can add more details to it using symbols and instances. Symbols are reusable elements that you can create once and use multiple times in your document. Instances are copies of symbols that you can place on the Stage and modify individually without affecting the original symbol. To create a symbol, select an object or a group of objects on the Stage and choose Modify > Convert to Symbol. To create an instance, drag a symbol from the Library panel to the Stage or copy and paste an existing instance on the Stage. For example, you can create a symbol for your character's body and place an instance of it below the head. You can also create symbols for your character's arms and legs and place instances of them on the body. You can then animate these instances using motion tweens as well.
